      <li>3 tablespoons minced garlic, divided</li>

      <li>1 (16 oz) package linguine pasta</li>

      <li>1 and 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
      <li>1 and 1/2 cups grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>4 egg yolks</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1/4 cup Sauvignon Blanc wine</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Cook and
        stir chicken with 1 tablespoon garlic and 1 tablespoon Italian
        seasoning, until cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer chicken to a
        bowl and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1 tablespoon garlic and 1 tablespoon olive oil in the same pan. Fry
        shrimp until red on the outside and white on the inside, 6 to 8 minutes.
        Place with the chicken.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add remaining 2 tablespoons
        olive oil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite,
        about 11 minutes. Drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add bacon to the pan; cook until just crispy, not crunchy, about 6
        minutes. Drain on 2 paper towels. Saute onion in the bacon grease until
        translucent, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        While onion is sauteeing, mix cream, Parmesan cheese, egg yolks, salt,
        pepper, and remaining Italian seasoning together in a bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour wine into the pan with the onions. Increase heat and bring to a
        boil. Cook until wine is mostly evaporated, about 2 minutes. Add the
        creamy egg mixture and reduce heat. Simmer until sauce begins to
        thicken, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the chicken and shrimp; mix to coat. Serve
        on top of pasta.
